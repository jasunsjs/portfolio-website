# Jason's Personal Website

Hey what's up!👋 

Welcome to my personal website, where I share a little more about myself beyond just the GitHub, Linkedin, or resume.

## Technologies

- Next.js 16 (React 19) with TypeScript (all mans hate JavaScript)
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the repo
git clone https://github.com/jasunsjs/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on your browser and you can go from there.

## Deployment & Domains

This website is currently deployed on Vercel, using the default **.vercel.app** subdomain. I previously had another website deployed under the domain **jasonsun.com**, but I recently lost it and now it costs around 7k.

I will most likely purchase another domain in the near future.
